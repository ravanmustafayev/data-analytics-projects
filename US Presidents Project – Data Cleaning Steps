1. Duplicate records removed

Menu: Data > Data Tools > Remove Duplicates

Result: Duplicate entry (Barack Obama) removed.

2. Standardizing case in “President” column

Added helper column → Formula: =PROPER([President])

Example corrections:

john tyler → John Tyler

JAMES MONROE → James Monroe

john adams → John Adams

Note: Could also use =UPPER() or =LOWER() depending on preference.

3. Cleaning “Party” column

Applied Filter to check unique categories.

Unified inconsistent labels (e.g., Republican vs. Republicans, Democratic vs. Demorcatic).

Important: Consistent party names enable proper grouping in dashboards.

4. Removing extra spaces in “Vice” column

Added helper column → Formula: =TRIM([Vice])

This removed unnecessary spaces around names.

5. Fixing “Salary” column

Removed dollar signs ($) from salary values.

Changed column format from Currency → Number.

Purpose: Prevents errors when loading into SQL.

6. Unifying date formats

Selected all date columns → Applied format Short Date (Home > Number > Short Date).

Adjusted inconsistent entries in the last two rows.

Optionally: Could use Long Date if preferred.

7. Breaking formula dependency (Vice-Fixed & President-Fixed)

Columns contained formulas (based on raw data).

To prevent future #REF! errors when deleting source columns:

Used Copy > Paste Values for fixed columns.

Deleted unnecessary raw data columns.

8. Removed unnecessary columns


Dropped irrelevant fields to keep dataset clean and concise.
